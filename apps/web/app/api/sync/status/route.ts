/**
 * Per-source sync health snapshot for the workspace UI.
 *
 * Returns whatever `getSyncStatus()` from `sync-runner.ts` is holding
 * for the Gmail + Calendar incremental loops, plus a synthesized
 * `gmailFresh` / `calendarFresh` boolean derived from the on-disk
 * sync-cursors file. The fresh booleans let the workspace render a
 * "we haven't successfully polled in N hours" banner even right after
 * a process restart, before the in-memory `lastSuccessAt` has had a
 * chance to populate from a real tick.
 *
 * No auth: this is workspace-local read-only state with no secrets in
 * the response. Same threat model as `/api/onboarding/sync/progress`.
 *
 * Why a polling endpoint instead of SSE:
 *
 * - The workspace banner only needs to flip every ~minute; sub-second
 *   updates would be over-engineering for an error state.
 * - SSE clients leak fd's during dev hot-reload more than fetch does,
 *   and we already pay the SSE cost in the onboarding wizard.
 * - Polling makes it trivial to render the banner from a server
 *   component or a /healthz curl, both of which we'd want eventually.
