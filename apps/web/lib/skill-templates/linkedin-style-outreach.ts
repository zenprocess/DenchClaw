  skillInstructions: [
    "Accept prospects from HubSpot/Dench CRM records, enrichment results, uploaded files, pasted names, Gmail relationship history, or manual search criteria; use LinkedIn when connected and useful for profile context.",
    "For each prospect, research lightweight public and CRM context that supports a specific opening line: role, company, recent change, mutual context, hiring/funding/news signal, or stated interest.",
    "Write concise LinkedIn-style messages with one clear CTA, no fabricated familiarity, no over-personalized claims, and no sensitive personal data unless the user explicitly provided it.",
    "Respect the selected send policy: draft by default; send only when the prospect matches explicit allowlists, daily caps, duplicate checks, quiet hours, and channel constraints.",
    "For scheduled runs, use idempotency checks against HubSpot/Dench CRM notes, Gmail history, prior Dench runs, and connected app history so the same prospect is not messaged twice for the same campaign.",
    "Stop outreach when a reply, accepted connection plus response, meeting booked, disqualifying CRM stage, do-not-contact flag, blocked signal, or owner override is detected.",
  ],
  activityLogInstructions: [
    "Log outreach-state entries on the CRM/contact record or social outreach campaign summary, never only inside the message draft.",
    "Record audience source, prospect researched, public/CRM evidence used, message variant, draft/send state, send policy gate, and next follow-up date.",
    "For each skipped prospect, log the concrete reason: duplicate campaign touch, cap, quiet hours, missing evidence, do-not-contact, reply, booked meeting, or owner override.",
    "For scheduled sequences, append only state transitions such as new draft, sent message, accepted/replied, stopped, or follow-up due.",
  ],
