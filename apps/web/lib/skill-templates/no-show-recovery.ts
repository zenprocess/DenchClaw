    "Identify likely no-shows from Calendar history, CRM meeting outcomes, uploaded logs, or manual input; verify attendance state during each manual or scheduled run instead of relying on webhooks.",
    "Use meeting title, attendees, CRM record, prior thread, and notes/files to understand context before writing a recovery message.",
    "Draft or send a fast, polite note that assumes positive intent, avoids blame, and offers the approved rescheduling path with minimal friction.",
    "Apply different wording for sales, customer, recruiting, founder, and investor/BD meetings so the note fits the relationship and stakes.",
    "Respect send guardrails including draft-vs-send mode, quiet hours, daily caps, booking-link rules, recipient exclusions, and duplicate prevention for the same missed meeting.",
    "For scheduled runs, check Calendar, Gmail, and CRM activity before each follow-up so the skill stops once a new meeting is booked, the person replies, the owner intervenes, or the record changes stage.",

    "For scheduled scans, append only newly detected no-shows, retry state changes, bookings recovered, and meetings suppressed because they were already processed.",
