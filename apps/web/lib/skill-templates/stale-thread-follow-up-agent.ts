    "Scan only the selected sources for stale conversations during manual or scheduled runs; do not rely on email webhooks or app callbacks.",
    "Rank threads by business value using CRM stage, deal amount, account importance, relationship strength, recent meeting context, and owner priority.",
    "Before drafting, summarize the thread history, last unanswered ask, likely next step, and CRM facts that change the recommendation.",

    "Send only when explicit rules allow it; otherwise create drafts or CRM tasks with the recommended send window.",
    "For scheduled runs, check Gmail, CRM, HubSpot, and prior Dench notes to avoid duplicate nudges and skip threads already handled by a teammate.",

    "Capture stop and skip reasons including reply detected, meeting booked, stage changed, do-not-contact, teammate handled, low value, or duplicate nudge.",
    "For scheduled runs, log only new stale threads, worsened inactivity, nudges created or sent, and threads that exited the queue since the previous scan.",
