    "Reference only role-relevant, candidate-provided, or authorized context; avoid pressure, guilt, or assumptions about personal circumstances.",
    "Route hiring-manager prompts as concise decisions with candidate, stage, aging, blocker, and suggested action.",
    "For scheduled runs, suppress unchanged stalled candidates and resurface only when the SLA worsens or a new owner action is due.",
